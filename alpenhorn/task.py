class Task:
    """An asynchronous I/O task handled by a worker thread.

    The task is placed into `queue` and waits for a worker thread
    to pop and execute it.

    The body of the task is provided by the `func` callable.
    While `func` is executing, the provided Task object can be used in
    func to register cleanup functions.

    The value returned from calling `func` is ignored.

    If `func` raises ``pw.OperationalError``, and the task is running in a
    worker, the worker will terminate (and be respawned by the main
    loop).  In this case, the value of `requeue` indicates how to handle
    re-running this task:
    - If `requeue` is True, the task will put a copy of itself back into
         the queue before exiting.  This is appropriate for Tasks
         produced by the `auto_import` watchers, which aren't going to
         fire again.
    - If `requeue` is false, the task is not requeued, but simply
         abandonned.  This is appropriate for Tasks produced by the main
         loop, since a subsequeunt update loop will determine whether
         the task needs to be performed again.

    All other uncaught exceptions from `func` will result in a global
    abort of alpenhorn.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
            the code executed by the worker.  The first positional
            argument to `func` is always the task itself.
    queue : FairMultiFIFOQueue
            the task is automatically added to this queue
    key : hashable
            the name of the FIFO used when added to `queuee
    requeue : boolean
            should the task be requeued if the worker aborts due to a DB
            error?  Typically ``True`` for `auto_import` tasks and
            ``False`` for main update loop tasks
    name : string
            the name of the task.  Used in log messages
    args : list or tuple
            additional positional arguments passed to `func`
    kwargs : dict
            keywork arguments passed to `func`
