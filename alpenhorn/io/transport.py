    This implements (the formerly special-cased) transport disk logic.

    A Transport StorageGroup is used to transfer data onto transiting
    storage.

    Features of a Transport StorageGroup:
        - it may have any number of nodes.  All node must have
            node.db.storage_type == 'T', but no restrictions are put on the
            io_class of nodes
        - all pulls to the StorageGroup must be local: non-local pull
            requests will be ignored
        - when handling pull requests, transport nodes are prioritised by
            increasing free space: the group will attempt to pull a file
            to the fullest node that it thinks it will fit on.
