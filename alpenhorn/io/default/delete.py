    """Try to delete a file's parent directory(s) from a node

    Will attempt to remove the enitre tree given as `dirname`
    while holding the `tree_lock` down until reaching `node.root`.
    Blocks until the lock can be acquired.

    The attempt to delete starts at `acq.name` and walks upwards until
    it runs out of path elements in `acq.name`.

    As soon as a non-empty directory is encountered, the attempt stops
    without raising an error.

    If `acq.name` is missing, or partially missing, that is not an error
    either, but an attempt to delete the part remaining will still be
    attempted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node: StorageNode
        The node to delete the acq directory from.
    dirname: pathlib.Path
        The path to delete.  Must be absolute and rooted at `node.root`.
    tree_lock: UpDownLock
        This function will block until it can acquire the down lock and
        all I/O will happen while holding the lock down.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        `dirname` was not a subdirectory of `node.root`
