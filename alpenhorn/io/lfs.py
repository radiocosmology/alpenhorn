"""lfs(1) wrapper.

This module provides the `LFS` class which wraps invocations of
`lfs(1)` to interact with a Lustre filesystem.

It is not a complete wrapper for that command and is only able to
run these commands:

* `lfs quota`
    to retrieve the group quota for a path.  The user group used
    must be provided to the constructor.  Can also handle a
    fixed max quota, for cases where "lfs quota" doesn't correctly
    report the max.
* `lfs hsm_state`
    to retrieve the HSM state for a file.  The state itself is
    represented with the `HSMState` enum and is one of:
        * `MISSING`:    file is not present on disk or external storage
        * `UNARCHIVED`: file exists on disk, but not on external storage
        * `RESTORED`:   file exists on both disk and external storage
        * `RELEASED`:   file exists in external storage only
* `lfs hsm_restore`
    requests the state change `RELEASED -> RESTORED`
* `lfs hsm_release`
    requests the state change `RESTORED -> RELEASED`
