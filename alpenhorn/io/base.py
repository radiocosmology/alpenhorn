            The value returned should be one of the `UpdateableNode` elements

        This method is only called if the attribute `do_pull_search` is ``True``.
        This provides the group an opportunity to search the group for an exising
        unregistered copy of a file which needs to be pulled into this group.

        If a search is performed and a file is found, this method should cancel
        the request, and instead request import of the existing file copy (by

        req : ArchiveFileCopyRequest
