"""UpDownLock: A two-way threading lock.

This is a shared two-way lock used for thread synchronization.

This lock behaves similarly to a regular `threading.RLock`, but
can be in one of three states: locked up, locked down, or
unlocked.

All threads wanting to acquire the lock must choose one of the
two locked states to acquire the lock in.  When the lock is
in one of the locked states, any other threads wanting to
acquire the lock in that same state may do so (i.e. multiple
threads can hold the lock in a particular state), but threads
wanting the other lock state must wait for the lock to become
unlocked before they can aquire the lock.

Alpenhorn uses this lock to prevent race conditions while
modifying the directory tree of a StorageNode: threads which
are in the process of creating directories must do so while
holding the up lock and threads which are in the process of
removing directories must do so while holding the down lock.

The lock ensures only one operation (creation or removal) can
happen at any given time.

    This is a threading synchronization primitive, similar to

    When locked in one of the states, any number of threads can
    hold the lock in that state, but threads attempting to
    acquire the lock in the other state must wait for the

    it has acquired the lock.

    The two states of the lock are accessed via `UpDownLock.up`
    and `UpDownLock.down`. These accessors provide `acquire` and
    `release` methods which work as they do with the standard
