    file : foreign key
        Reference to the file of which this is a copy.
    node : foreign key
        The node on which this copy lives (or should live).
    has_file : enum
        Is the file on the node?
        - 'Y': yes, the node has a copy of the file.
        - 'N': no, the node does not have the file.
        - 'M': maybe: the file copy needs to be re-checked.
        - 'X': the file is there, but has been verified to be corrupted.
    wants_file : enum
        Does the node want the file?
        - 'Y': yes, keep the file around
        - 'M': maybe, can delete if we need space
        - 'N': no, should be deleted

    ready : bool
        _Some_ StorageNode I/O classes use this to tell other hosts that
        files are ready for access.  Other I/O classes do _not_ use this
        field and assess readiness in some other way, so never check this
        directly; outside of the I/O-class code itself, use
        StorageNode.io.ready_path() or StorageNode.remote.pull_ready()
        to determine whether a remote file is ready for I/O.
    size_b : integer
        Allocated size of file in bytes (i.e. actual size on the Storage
        medium.)
    last_update : timestamp
        The time at which this record was last updated.  If using
        a MySQL database, this property is automatically set to the
        current time whenever the row is updated.
